# A simple example of reading data from a .json file with Python,
# using the built-in "json" library. The data used here is an instance of
# https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=U6RATE& \
# file_type=json&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# import the `json` library, since that's our source file format
import json

# import the `csv` library, to create our output file
import csv

# choose a filename
filename = "U6_FRED_data"
path = "C:\\Users\\f_ayx\\OneDrive\\Documents\\data_wrangling_exercises\\chapter_4_examples\\standalone_files\\"

# open the file in read format ("r") as usual
json_source_file = open(path+filename+".json","r")

# pass the `json_source_file` as an ingredient to the json library's `load()`
# method and store the result in a variable called `json_data`
json_data = json.load(json_source_file)

# create our output file, naming it "json_"+filename
output_file = open(path+"json_"+filename+".csv","w")

# use the `csv` library's "writer" recipe to easily write rows of data
# to `output_file`, instead of reading data *from* it
output_writer = csv.writer(output_file)

# grab the first element (at position "0"), and use its keys as the column headers
output_writer.writerow(list(json_data["observations"][0].keys()))

for obj in json_data["observations"]:

    # we'll create an empty list where we'll put the actual values of each object
    obj_values = []

    # for every `key` (which will become a column), in each object
    for key, value in obj.items():

        # let's print what's in here, just to see how the code sees it
        print(key,value)

        # add the values to our list
        obj_values.append(value)

    # now we've got the whole row, write the data to our output file
    output_writer.writerow(obj_values)

# officially close the `.csv` file we just wrote all that data to
output_file.close()
